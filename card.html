                <p>All Angelfish have a beautiful elegant look to them, but the regal angelfish is one of the most 
                    beautiful. It is also one of the most difficult to keep in an aquarium.
                    They grow to around 10 inches in length, which means they require a huge tank (a minimum of 100 gallons with plenty of hiding spots). 
                    In the wild they prefer areas that are naturally rich in coral reefs, and they stay close to 
                    areas with plenty of cracks, caves, and crevices. They typically live singly or in mated pairs.</p>
